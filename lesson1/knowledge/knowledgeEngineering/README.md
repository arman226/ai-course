# Clue Game with Knowledge Engineering

## Introduction

This Python code implements a simplified version of the CLUE board game using knowledge engineering principles. The game involves deducing the culprit, murder weapon, and location of a crime based on the clues obtained.

## Code Overview

The code consists of a `ClueGame` class that represents the game and manages the knowledge base and player information. Here's an overview of the key components:

- `ClueGame`: This class initializes the game with a list of suspects, weapons, and rooms. It also maintains the knowledge base (`kb`) to track information about suspect, weapon, and room combinations.

- `add_clue`: This method allows players to add clues to the knowledge base. It marks the given combination as true in the knowledge base and updates the player's knowledge with the new clue.

- `make_deductions`: This method makes deductions based on the knowledge base. It iterates over each player's knowledge and deduces false combinations that are not marked as true in the knowledge base.

## Knowledge Engineering

Knowledge engineering is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with designing and building systems that exhibit intelligent behavior by leveraging explicit knowledge representations. In the context of the CLUE game:

- **Knowledge Representation**: The knowledge base (`kb`) represents the explicit knowledge about suspect, weapon, and room combinations. It enables the game to track and reason about the available clues.

- **Inference and Deduction**: The `make_deductions` method performs inference and deduction based on the knowledge base. It makes logical deductions about false combinations that are not consistent with the available clues.

- **Knowledge Acquisition**: Players acquire knowledge by observing clues during the game. The `add_clue` method updates the knowledge base with new information, allowing players to make informed deductions.

## Usage

To use the code, simply create an instance of the `ClueGame` class and add clues using the `add_clue` method. You can then make deductions using the `make_deductions` method to deduce false combinations based on the available clues.

Example usage:

```python
game = ClueGame()
game.add_clue('Miss Scarlett', 'Candlestick', 'Ballroom', 'Player 1')
game.add_clue('Colonel Mustard', 'Knife', 'Library', 'Player 2')
game.make_deductions()
```

## Conclusion

This code demonstrates how knowledge engineering principles can be applied to model and reason about complex problem domains, such as detective games like CLUE. By representing explicit knowledge and performing inference and deduction, intelligent behavior can be exhibited in AI systems.
