# NumPy

## 1. Introduction

NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a broad range of mathematical functions, making it essential for scientific and engineering applications.

## 2. Why it is needed for Artificial Intelligence

NumPy is crucial for AI due to its efficiency in handling large datasets and performing mathematical operations. Its capabilities enable the development and implementation of machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing, which are foundational for AI systems.

## 3. NumPy vs List

### Advantages of NumPy:

- **Performance:** Faster due to efficient memory usage and optimized C backend.
- **Functionality:** Offers extensive mathematical functions and operations.
- **Convenience:** Supports multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

### Disadvantages of NumPy:

- **Complexity:** Learning curve for beginners.
- **Flexibility:** Less flexible compared to Python lists for non-numerical data.

### Advantages of Lists:

- **Simplicity:** Easy to use and understand for beginners.
- **Flexibility:** Can store different data types.

### Disadvantages of Lists:

- **Performance:** Slower due to overhead and lack of optimization.
- **Functionality:** Limited in terms of numerical and mathematical operations.

## 4. When to use NumPy

Use NumPy when dealing with large datasets, performing complex mathematical computations, or requiring operations on multi-dimensional arrays. Ideal for tasks in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.

## 5. Why use NumPy

NumPy is used for its speed, efficiency, and powerful array-handling capabilities. It is the backbone of many data processing and machine learning libraries, making it indispensable for numerical computations and data manipulation tasks.

## 6. How to use NumPy

### 1. Installation

```bash
pip install numpy
```

### 2. Importing NumPy

```python
import numpy as np
```

### 3. Creating Arrays

```python
# Creating a 1D array
array_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Creating a 2D array
array_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
```

### 4. Basic Operations

```python
# Element-wise addition
array_sum = array_1d + 5

# Matrix multiplication
array_mul = np.dot(array_2d, array_2d.T)

# Statistical operations
mean_value = np.mean(array_1d)
std_deviation = np.std(array_1d)

```

### 5. Indexing and Slicing

```python
# Indexing
element = array_1d[0]

# Slicing
sub_array = array_2d[:, 1]

```

### 6. Reshaping

```python
# Reshape 1D array to 2D
reshaped_array = array_1d.reshape((5, 1))

```

### Broadcasting

```python
# Broadcasting example
broadcast_array = array_1d + np.array([1])

```
