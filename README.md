## LESSON 2 [Python Libraries]

1. **NumPy**: For numerical computing and efficient handling of arrays and matrices.
2. **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis, especially when working with structured data.
3. **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization, essential for understanding and presenting insights from data.
4. **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
5. **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: For deep learning and neural network implementation.
6. **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, which can run on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit.
7. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or SpaCy**: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, POS tagging, and named entity recognition.
8. **OpenCV**: For computer vision tasks like image processing and object detection.
